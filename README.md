## About this Project
In this repository, we have provided you a REST (REpresentational State Transfer) API project using Rocket web framework.

This project consists of four modules:
1.  `controller`: this module contains handler functions used to receive request and send responses.
    In Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, this is the Controller part.
2.  `model`: this module contains structs that serve as data containers.
    In MVC pattern, this is the Model part.
3.  `service`: this module contains structs with business logic methods.
    In MVC pattern, this is also the Model part.
4.  `repository`: this module contains structs that serve as databases and methods to access the databases.
    You can use methods of the struct to get list of objects, or operating an object (create, read, update, delete).

This repository provides a basic functionality that makes BambangShop work: ability to create, read, and delete `Product`s.
This repository already contains a functioning `Product` model, repository, service, and controllers that you can try right away.

As this is an Observer Design Pattern tutorial repository, you need to implement another feature: `Notification`.
This feature will notify creation, promotion, and deletion of a product, to external subscribers that are interested of a certain product type.
The subscribers are another Rocket instances, so the notification will be sent using HTTP POST request to each subscriber's `receive notification` address.

## API Documentations

You can download the Postman Collection JSON here: https://ristek.link/AdvProgWeek7Postman

After you download the Postman Collection, you can try the endpoints inside "BambangShop Publisher" folder.
This Postman collection also contains endpoints that you need to implement later on (the `Notification` feature).

Postman is an installable client that you can use to test web endpoints using HTTP request.
You can also make automated functional testing scripts for REST API projects using this client.
You can install Postman via this website: https://www.postman.com/downloads/

## How to Run in Development Environment
1.  Set up environment variables first by creating `.env` file.
    Here is the example of `.env` file:
    ```bash
    APP_INSTANCE_ROOT_URL="http://localhost:8000"
    ```
    Here are the details of each environment variable:
    | variable              | type   | description                                                |
    |-----------------------|--------|------------------------------------------------------------|
    | APP_INSTANCE_ROOT_URL | string | URL address where this publisher instance can be accessed. |
2.  Use `cargo run` to run this app.
    (You might want to use `cargo check` if you only need to verify your work without running the app.)

## Your Reflections
This is the place for you to write reflections:

### Mandatory (Publisher) Reflections

#### Reflection Publisher-1

1. In the Observer pattern diagram explained by the Head First Design Pattern book, Subscriber is defined as an interface. Explain based on your understanding of Observer design patterns, do we still need an interface (or trait in Rust) in this BambangShop case, or a single Model struct is enough?

In the Observer pattern, defining Subscriber as a trait (or interface) is generally useful for maintaining flexibility and extensibility. However, in the current BambangShop case, a single Subscriber struct is sufficient since all subscribers follow the same structure without variations. If different types of subscribers with unique behaviors were needed in the future, implementing a trait would allow polymorphism and better code maintainability.

2. id in Program and url in Subscriber is intended to be unique. Explain based on your understanding, is using Vec (list) sufficient or using DashMap (map/dictionary) like we currently use is necessary for this case?

The id in Program and the url in Subscriber serve as unique identifiers. While a Vec (list) could be used to store subscribers, it would require linear searches (O(n)) for lookups, additions, and deletions. Using DashMap, which is a thread-safe concurrent HashMap, ensures O(1) lookups and provides better performance, especially when handling a large number of subscribers. Given that unique identification and quick access are critical, DashMap is the better choice for this implementation.

3. When programming using Rust, we are enforced by rigorous compiler constraints to make a thread-safe program. In the case of the List of Subscribers (SUBSCRIBERS) static variable, we used the DashMap external library for thread safe HashMap. Explain based on your understanding of design patterns, do we still need DashMap or we can implement Singleton pattern instead?

While the Singleton pattern ensures that there is only one instance of SUBSCRIBERS throughout the application using lazy_static!, it does not inherently handle concurrent access safely. Rust enforces thread safety, meaning that if multiple threads access and modify shared data, we need a mechanism to prevent data races. Using a standard HashMap within a Singleton would require additional synchronization, such as wrapping it with a Mutex or RwLock, which could introduce performance bottlenecks due to locking overhead.

In contrast, DashMap is specifically designed for concurrent access, allowing multiple threads to read and write to different keys simultaneously with fine-grained locking. This makes it more efficient than a Mutex<HashMap>, where the entire structure would be locked even for independent operations. Therefore, while a Singleton pattern provides a globally accessible instance, it is not a replacement for DashMap in this case. We still need DashMap to ensure efficient and safe concurrent modifications, making it the better choice for managing subscribers in a multi-threaded environment.
